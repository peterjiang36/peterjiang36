**`Software Engineer/Skier/Tennis & Badminton Player/Outdoorsy`**

### :man_technologist: About Me :<br> 

I'm currently pursuing a Computer Science Honours degree at the University of Saskatchewan. I have a passion for building things with code, whether it's debugging complex logic, perfecting the user experience of a web page, or bringing a new idea to life. My attention to detail means I can easily spend hours fine-tuning solutions until they’re just right.

When I’m not coding, I love being outdoors! In the winter, you’ll find me skiing down slopes, and in the summer, I’m usually on the tennis court. One of my dreams is to visit as many ski resorts and tennis academies around the world as possible. I’m also an outdoor enthusiast who enjoys hiking and camping—especially road trips with RVs or camper vans.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Forrest's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world - code, unix, linux, theory. And all the while, teaching myself iOS development with a dream to build my own app, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in Java. A desire that landed me a full-stack software engineering job upon graduation. However, I had another desire I had been pursuing throughout this time - YouTube content creation. I eventually ended up quitting my software engineering job to pursue YouTube full-time, and that has been my focus ever since. But there's something that's always bothered me about my journey - abandoning my dream of building my own app to pursue the safe route, a job. Now I've already taken the leap away from that safety net into this uncomfortable, unexplored world that it being a creator. And it worked out, but again, it became comfortable. It's easier to create a video than go out on a ledge and build my own product. I do have to eat, at the end of the day, but I think it's time. It's time to get uncomfortable again. I have a burning desire to get back on the horse, and fulfill that dream younger me had of building my own app, my own product. And in order to do that, I'll be implmementing a few measures to streamline my YouTube content to focus more time on fulfilling that dream - a dream that I'll be ready to tackle in 2023 due to the measure I'm putting in place now until the end of 2022. Don't wait up, because I'm coming.
